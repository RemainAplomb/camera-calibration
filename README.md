## Brief Description

The ConsoleApplication1 application has been created using AppWizard.

This file provides a summary of the components that comprise the ConsoleApplication1 application, including all files and their respective contents.

## ConsoleApplication1.vcxproj

This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated by App Wizard. It contains information about the version of Visual C++ used to create the file, as well as details regarding the platform, configuration, and project features selected through the application wizard.

## ConsoleApplication1.vcxproj.filters

This is a filter file for VC++ projects generated by App Wizard. The file contains information about the associations between files and filters within your project. These associations are utilized in the IDE to group files with similar extensions under specific nodes (e.g., ".cpp" files are associated with the "Source Files" filter).

## ConsoleApplication1.cpp

This file contains the main source code for the application.

## Other standard files

### StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp

These files are utilized to build a precompiled header (PCH) file named ConsoleApplication1.pch and a precompiled object file named StdAfx.obj.

## TODO

Identify parts of the source code that need to be added or customized.
